# Ducky
Coders Lab Final Project

Ducky is a project inspired by the popular notion of the rubber duck debugging method:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging

The method was introduced to me in the first days of my JavaScript Developer course, offered
by Coders Lab IT School. I found the idea to be very unusual and interesting and I decided to
code my own rubber ducky as my final project (which was a requirement to pass the above mentioned
course). 

Ducky is a simple interactive toy, created in JavaScript and using Three.js and Cannon.js libraries
to WebGl rendering and physics. The user can throw ducky and objects around the 3d space and also
squish the rubber guy by double clicking. 

Future planned functionality:

-chat with ducky,
-adding keyboard input for additional methods of ducky.
